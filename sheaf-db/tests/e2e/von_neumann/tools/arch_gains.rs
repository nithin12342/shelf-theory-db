// ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT CANDIDATES, measured.
//
// Four candidate changes, each grounded in a measurement rather than a
// guess. The question for each: does the change actually buy anything, and
// how much?
//
//   C1. Whole-file read vs a range read for one section.
//       The bundle reader calls std::fs::read on the whole file, so a query
//       that needs 201.7 MB of sections pays for 1,439.1 MB.
//   C2. A second memory channel.
//       The host has ONE populated DDR4 channel. The peak is 25.6 GB/s.
//   C3. Large pages.
//       The STLB reach is 6 MiB and the L3 is 12 MiB, so a random access
//       pattern always walks the page table.
//   C4. Parallel fiber build.
//       The IMDb bundle build is 51.1 s. If it is single-threaded, the
//       parallelism headroom is the build time divided by the core count.
//
// STANDALONE TOOL. Compile and run from this directory:
//   rustc -O arch_gains.rs -o arch_gains.exe && ./arch_gains.exe
