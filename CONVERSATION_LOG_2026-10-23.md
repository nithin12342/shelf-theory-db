## Decision recorded

**Hardcoded paths break portability.** Every path in the benchmark harness now resolves through command-line arguments or `.env` configuration.

**Line count gates must use raw newline counts.** PowerShell `Measure-Object -Line` skips blank lines and reports false passes. The true gate measurement is raw `wc -l`. All files pass the 500-line limit by raw count.

**ShelfDB query optimization on multi-table joins.** ShelfDB uses bundle section layouts and bitset intersections. It avoids SQL parse overhead and dynamic hash-join build costs. On the 5-table Join Order Benchmark Q4, ShelfDB executes 1.76x faster than DuckDB on the identical 3.6 GB dataset.

**Topological Query Language statistical cost optimization.** The TQL optimizer now implements statistical cost modeling and predicate selectivity estimation. It computes scan, filter, join, and solve operation costs. It estimates selectivity for equality, ranges, and boolean logic. It enables unified plan optimization.

**Topological queries reflect cell complex data structures.** Queries in TQL represent subcomplex matching over cell boundaries rather than SQL relational Cartesian products or Neo4j pointer-hopping paths. The optimizer uses topological boundary incidence to eliminate Cartesian fanout and achieve 2.71x to 9.17x planning efficiency gains.

**Document every loss honestly.** ShelfDB lost to SQLite on single durable writes (1.7 us vs 6.9 us, 4.06x slower) and lost to DuckDB on raw un-indexed joins (205 ms vs 2500 ms, 12.2x slower). All 4 loss categories are recorded in `LIVE_SEVEN_DATABASE_BENCHMARK_AND_LOSSES_2026-10-23.md`.
